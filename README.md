## Vuejs-pfe

> This is a vuejs project mainly about consuming github APIs.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
## Notes

* The main components are within a separate file in ./src/components folder.
* API is consumed as unauthenticated user which means up to 60 requests per hour (https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting).
* I deployed a demo version on my server: http://138.197.117.115:3000
